# Git Merge Practice

This repository is a practice project for learning and experimenting with Git merge operations, including creating branches, committing changes, and resolving merge conflicts. It serves as an excellent resource for beginners and intermediate developers to understand Git workflows and conflict resolution techniques.

---

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How to create and switch branches in Git.
- Committing and pushing changes to remote repositories.
- Performing merges, including fast-forward merges and conflict resolution.
- Best practices for Git workflows in collaborative environments.

## ðŸ›  Steps Followed in This Project

### 1. **Cloned the Repository**
   The repository was cloned from GitHub to a local machine to start practicing Git commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kirankumarvel/git-merge-practice.git
   cd git-merge-practice
   ```

### 2. **Created a Feature Branch**
   A new branch called `feature-branch` was created from the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

### 3. **Made Changes on Feature Branch**
   Changes were made in the `feature-branch`, such as adding a new line of text to the `README.md` file:
   ```bash
   echo "Feature 1 implemented" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Added Feature 1 details"
   ```

### 4. **Pushed the Feature Branch**
   The changes made in the feature branch were pushed to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

### 5. **Merged the Feature Branch into Main**
   The changes from the `feature-branch` were merged into the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   git push origin main
   ```
   - A **fast-forward merge** was performed if no conflicts were present.

### 6. **Resolved Merge Conflicts**
   In case of merge conflicts:
   - Conflicted files were manually edited.
   - Post-resolution, the following commands were used:
     ```bash
     git add <conflicted-file>
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
     git push origin main
     ```

echo "Feature 1 implemented" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added Feature 1 details"
```

### Push the Feature Branch
```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

### Switch to Main and Merge

git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

### Push the Merged Changes

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Practicing
1. Always pull the latest changes from the `main` branch before merging to avoid unnecessary conflicts:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Use `git status` frequently to check the status of your working directory and staged files.
3. If you encounter conflicts during a merge:
   - Open the conflicted files in a text editor.
   - Resolve conflicts by manually editing the files.
   - Use `git add` to stage the resolved files and `git commit` to finalize the merge.
